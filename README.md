# What is the MERN Stack?
The MERN stack is a set of technologies used to create a web application. It is composed of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node. The "*M*" in MERN stands for MongoDB and serves as the database for the web application. The "*E*" in MERN stands for Express which is a web server framework running in an "*N*", which in MERN which stands for Node, environment. Express and Node are associated with one another. Finally, the "*R*" in MERN stands for React which is a library responsible for creating the user interface that users interact with on a browser or mobile client.

The MERN stack allows developers to quickly construct a three-tier architecture web application which is composed of the front-end, the back-end, and the database by solely using Javascript and JSON. The front-end aspect of the web application is handled by React. The user interface is adapts or accommodates the data received from the back-end which is handled by Node and Express. The data that the back-end operates on is stored and retrieved from the database which is handled by MongoDB.
